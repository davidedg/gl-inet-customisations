After reviewing your Busybox ash script, I can identify potential vulnerabilities or areas that could be improved for better security:

1. Command Execution

    The line "$command" "$from_number" "$sms_text" executes a command based on user input. If an attacker manages to send an SMS with malicious text that matches one of the allowed commands, they could potentially exploit this functionality.

    To mitigate this, validate the $command variable to ensure it contains only pre-approved values and strictly avoid executing untrusted user input. Consider using a case statement rather than direct command execution.

2. SMS File Path

    The variable $sms_file_path is used without sanitization. If an attacker can craft a malicious value for sms_file_path, they could potentially execute unintended commands or delete critical files when the script runs rm -f $sms_file_path.

    Ensure $sms_file_path is sanitized and check for paths outside expected directories using tools like readlink or realpath to prevent path traversal attacks.

3. Allowed Numbers

    The script checks if the sender number matches one in ALLOWED_NUMBERS. While this is a good starting point, spoofing SMS sender numbers is relatively easy. If sender authentication is critical, consider implementing additional verification methods such as encrypted tokens or digital signatures.

4. Allowed Commands

    The list of allowed commands is stored in the ALLOWED_COMMANDS variable. If the script execution context is compromised, an attacker could modify these variables and expand their functionality to execute arbitrary commands.

    As a precaution, consider hardcoding allowed commands into the script or storing them in a secure, read-only configuration file.

5. Reading SMS Content

    The use of awk to extract SMS content could be fragile and prone to errors if the SMS format changes. Ensure robust parsing logic to handle unexpected content and validate input before proceeding with processing.

6. Race Conditions

    If the SMS file is modified after the script reads it but before processing, this could lead to unintended behavior. Use file locks to ensure the file cannot be tampered with during execution.

7. Default Exit Codes

    The script uses exit codes like exit 0 and exit 128 without clear documentation on why specific codes are chosen. Ensure consistency and clarify these codes to avoid confusion or unintended processing by other scripts.

Recommendations:

    Validate all inputs rigorously and avoid directly executing commands based on user input.

    Implement logging to track script execution and identify potential misuse.

    Limit script access and execution to trusted users and environments.

Let me know if you'd like help refining your script or implementing these security measures!
